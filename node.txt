
This code snippet is a basic Node.js application using the Express.js framework to create a 
server that serves static files from a directory named "public". Let's break down the code:


const express = require('express');

This line imports the Express.js framework into the application. Express.js is a popular 
web framework for Node.js, used for building web applications and APIs.



const app = express();

This line initializes an Express application by calling the express() function, which creates 
an instance of an Express application.



app.use(express.static('public'));

This line configures Express to serve static files from the "public" directory.
The express.static() middleware function is used to serve static files such as 
HTML, CSS, images, and JavaScript files.
In this case, any files placed in the "public" directory will be served by the Express server.



app.listen(4000, () => {
    console.log("Server is started");
});

This line starts the Express server and makes it listen for incoming HTTP requests on port 4000.
The app.listen() method takes two arguments: the port number to listen on and a callback function
 that is executed once the server starts successfully.
In this case, it logs a message "Server is started" to the console once the server is running.
